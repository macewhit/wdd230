        <h2> Audience </h2>
        <h3> Target Audience </h3>
        <p> The Utah Valley Chamber of Commerce's target audience is local businesses located in Utah Valley,
            whether it is a start-up or well-established business. The website will be a place where Valley residents can find out more about businesses near them, and a place where businesses can network and be highlighted. </p>

        <h3> Personas </h3>
        <h4> Rachel Marin - Restaurant Owner </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 35 years old </li>
            <li> Married </li>
            <li> Mother of 4 children </li>
            <li> Associate's in Culinary Skills </li>
        </ul>
        <p> She has always wanted her own business and the quality of her restaurant is thriving, but feels she is lacking in the variety and amount of people who come.
            She hopes the site will bring more patrons and further promote her business. She spends most of her time perfecting recipes, managing the budget, hiring new employees and ordering shipments</p>

        <h4> Larry Karl - Vice President of Marketing </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 55 years old </li>
            <li> Married </li>
            <li> Father of 2 children </li>
            <li> Master's in Business/Marketing </li>
        </ul>
        <p> While the company he works for is well-known and has been around for decades,  he hopes to be provided with modern ideas and an opportunity for networking with other businesses.
            He manages many teams, coordinates meetings, sets up conferences, comes up with the business marketing plans, and delegates tasks to employees. </p>
